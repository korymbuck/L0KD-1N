L0KD-1N is a simple calisthenic tracking web app built for people who like simplicity and minimalism. I was tired of apps having a millions things going on when all I wanted was a simple way to track easy workouts without the need for subscriptions or a bunch of pages to navigate through.

Current planned updates is a friends system with a leaderboard for the week so users can compete with their friends and incentivize working out / using the app.
